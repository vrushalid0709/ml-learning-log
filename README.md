# ML Learning Log

This repository documents my transition from backend development to applied machine learning.

It contains:
- Small experiments and notebooks
- Notes on data preprocessing and model evaluation
- Incremental learning projects (work in progress)

This repo is intentionally evolving as I build stronger ML foundations.
